		<p>
			Farm-to-table (or farm-to-fork) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm-to-table"><b>social
					movement</b></a>
			which promotes serving local food through direct acquisition from the producers.
			This can be accomplished through a direct sales relationship,
			a community-supported agriculture arrangement, a farmer's market,
			a local distributor or by the restaurant raising its own food.
			Farm-to-table often incorporates a form of food traceability where the origin of the food is identified to
			consumers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The farm-to-table movement has arisen with changes in attitudes about food safety, food freshness, food
			seasonality,
			and small-farm economics. Advocates and practitioners of the farm-to-table model frequently cite the
			scarcity of fresh,
			local ingredients; the poor flavor of ingredients shipped from afar; the poor nutritional integrity of
			shipped ingredients;
			the disappearance of small family farms; the disappearance of heirloom and open-pollinated fruits and
			vegetables;
			and the dangers of a highly centralized food growing and distribution system as motivators for their
			decision to adopted
			a more locavore approach to the food system.
